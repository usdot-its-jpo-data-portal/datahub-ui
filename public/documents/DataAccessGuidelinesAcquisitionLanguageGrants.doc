        <p>Use case 1: Grants and funding agreements with a need for data</=
p>
<p><strong>Updated as of: </strong>7/9/20</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: </strong>This document reflects the policy objective=
s of the ITS JPO, specifically the <a href=3D"https://www.its.dot.gov/data/=
#/resources/guidelines" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">Data Acces=
s Guidelines</a>, and applies ONLY to research projects funded, either full=
y or partially, by the ITS JPO. This document may not be suitable for other=
 U.S. DOT or non-U.S. DOT missions. For any questions or concerns regarding=
 the applicability of this document or the <a href=3D"https://www.its.dot.g=
ov/data/#/resources/guidelines" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">IT=
S JPO Data Access Guidelines</a>, please contact the ITS JPO at <a href=3D"=
mailto:data.itsjpo@dot.gov" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">data.i=
tsjpo@dot.gov</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I. Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>The <a href=3D"https://www.its.dot.gov/data/#/resources/guidelines" clas=
s=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">ITS JPO Data Access Guidelines</a>&nbs=
p;outline key requirements that increase the ITS JPO=E2=80=99s return on in=
vestment for collecting or creating data, including making this data public=
ly accessible. To operationalize these requirements, solicitations for ITS =
JPO projects producing data must have procurement language requiring adhere=
nce to relevant portions of the <a href=3D"https://www.its.dot.gov/data/#/r=
esources/guidelines" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">ITS JPO Data =
Access Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p><strong>II. How to Use This Language</strong></p>
<p>The below language is meant to be put into ITS JPO-funded grant and fund=
ing agreement solicitations that will collect or create data. This language=
 should be tailored and inserted as appropriate for specific procurements. =
ITS JPO Program Managers and acquisition personnel are anticipated to make =
the determination of what language should be incorporated for a specific so=
licitation. It is recommended that as much of this language as possible is =
incorporated for projects that will collect or create data. For more inform=
ation on the Data Management Plan deliverables requested as part of this la=
nguage, see the&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://its.dot.gov/data/#/resources/data-m=
anagement/data-management" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">ITS JPO=
=E2=80=99s Data Management Resources</a> page, including Templates &amp; In=
structions.</p>
<p>ITS JPO Program Managers and acquisition personnel must consider includi=
ng elements of this language in a procurement if a grant or funding agreeme=
nt <em>might</em>&nbsp;collect or create data, even if it is not an explici=
t deliverable or deemed necessary at the solicitation stage. In particular,=
 all grants and funding agreements should incorporate the Data Rights porti=
on of this language, as not including this section opens up the U.S. DOT to=
 risk that it will not have appropriate rights to data collected or created=
 over the course of a project. If a project is expected to produce source c=
ode, ITS JPO Program Managers and acquisition personnel must also consider =
adding <a href=3D"https://usdotjpoode.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ODTD/pages/=
1067450730/Source+Code+Guidelines+Acquisition+Language+-+Grants" rel=3D"nof=
ollow">procurement language</a> requiring adherence to the <a href=3D"https=
://www.its.dot.gov/code/#/source-code-guidelines" class=3D"external-link" r=
el=3D"nofollow">ITS JPO Source Code Guidelines</a>. This language may overl=
ap in parts with the below language, so ITS JPO Program Managers and acquis=
ition personnel must review all language (source code and data) to make sur=
e it is clear, concise, not duplicative, and obtains appropriate artifacts =
and requirements for the ITS JPO.</p>
