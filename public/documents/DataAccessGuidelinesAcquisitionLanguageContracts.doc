 U.S. DOT or non-U.S. DOT missions. For any questions or concerns regarding=
 the applicability of this document or the <a href=3D"https://www.its.dot.g=

<p><strong>I. Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>The <a href=3D"https://www.its.dot.gov/data/#/resources/guidelines" clas=
s=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">ITS JPO Data Access Guidelines</a>&nbs=
p;outline key requirements that increase the ITS JPO=E2=80=99s return on in=
vestment for collecting or creating data, including making this data public=
ly accessible and open source. To operationalize these requirements, solici=
tations for ITS JPO projects producing data must have procurement language =
requiring adherence to relevant portions of the <a href=3D"https://www.its.=
dot.gov/data/#/resources/guidelines" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollo=
w">ITS JPO Data Access Guidelines</a>.&nbsp;<span style=3D"color: rgb(23,43=
,77);text-decoration: none;">The below language lays out requirements for P=
rogram Managers and acquisition personnel to input into ITS JPO-funded cont=
racts that will create or collect data. This language is meant to be tailor=
ed as appropriate for specific procurements and requirements.&nbsp;</span><=
/p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(23,43,77);text-decoration: none;">ITS JPO Prog=
ram Managers and acquisition personnel must consider including elements of =
this language in a procurement if contract&nbsp;<em>might</em>&nbsp;collect=
 or create data, even if it is not an explicit deliverable or deemed necess=
ary at the solicitation stage. <span style=3D"color: rgb(23,43,77);text-dec=
oration: none;"> In particular, not including the Data Rights portion of th=
is language opens up the U.S. DOT to risk that it will not receive or have =
appropriate rights to source code developed over the course of a project.</=
span>&nbsp;If a project is expected to produce source code, ITS JPO Program=
 Managers and acquisition personnel must also consider adding <a href=3D"ht=
tps://usdotjpoode.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ODTD/pages/1067450730/Source+Co=

anguage</a> requiring adherence to the <a href=3D"https://www.its.dot.gov/c=
ode/#/source-code-guidelines" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">ITS =
JPO Source Code Guidelines</a>. This language may overlap in parts with the=
 below language, so ITS JPO Program Managers and acquisition personnel must=
 review all language (source code and data) to make sure it is clear, conci=
se, not duplicative, and obtains appropriate artifacts and requirements for=
 the ITS JPO.</span></p>
<p><strong>II. How to Use This Language</strong></p>
<p>This language is meant to be inserted into ITS JPO procurements for cont=
racts by ITS JPO Program Managers and/or acquisition personnel. For more in=
formation on Data Management Plan deliverables requested as part of this la=
nguage, see the&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://its.dot.gov/data/#/resources/data-m=
