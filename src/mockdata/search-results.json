These VADs recorded vehicle data during the World Congress and continue to operate after the World Congress.  Periodically the VADs are removed from the vehicles and the data files are retrieved.

This dataset consists of Traveler Information Messages (TIMs) transmitted by road-side units (RSU) located throughout the Tampa CV Pilot Study area.
