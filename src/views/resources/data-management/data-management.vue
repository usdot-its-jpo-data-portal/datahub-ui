    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Proper data management is a key component of the ITS JPO’s mission to lead “collaborative and innovative research, development, and implementation of intelligent transportation systems to improve the safety and mobility of people and goods.” Data management enables the ITS JPO to ensure research data is properly cared for and made accessible to the public and third-party researchers to propel ITS research forward and maximize the utility of the data. Projects should budget appropriately for any costs associated with data management.</p>
    <p>
      To assist with proper data management, the ITS JPO created this page to help data providers and project managers adhere to U.S. DOT and federal data policies, as well as general data management best practices. Check back regularly for the latest resources.
