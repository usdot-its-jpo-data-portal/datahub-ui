    <h2 id="Background-and-Purpose">Background and Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The mission of the ITS JPO is to support "the overall advancement of ITS through investments in major
      research initiatives, exploratory studies and a deployment support program including technology transfer
      and training." To further this mission, the ITS JPO Data Center of Excellence is committed to providing
      timely access to public research data to support third-party research, evaluation, and application development
      in order to maximize the ITS JPOâ€™s investment in ITS research initiatives. 
    </p>
    <p>
      These requirements outline ITS JPO's standards for maximizing access to ITS research data while protecting
      data integrity, data security, data management best practices, copyright laws, privacy, confidentiality,
      and confidential business information.
    </p>
    <p>
      These requirements build upon broader federal and United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT)

      <li class="dh-listtype__upperalpha">
        <h3>Data Management Plan</h3>
      </li>
      <p>
        Applicants must include a draft Data Management Plan (DMP) in their proposal. The U.S. DOT will use the
        information in the draft DMP as part of its evaluation criteria for award and may ask for clarifications or
        changes from applicants prior to award to ensure the U.S. DOT and/or public receives appropriate data access.
        The draft DMP must provide a preliminary overview of data that may be collected or created through the project,
        and include the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          DATA DESCRIPTION: Address the nature, scope, and scale of the data that will be collected or created.
          Define data elements within a detailed data dictionary.
        </li>
        <li>
          ACCESS POLICIES: Describe any access restrictions that may apply to your data.
        </li>
        <li>
          DATA STORAGE AND RETENTION: Describe where you intend to store your data and why you have chosen that
          particular option. Different systems may be designated for different types of data (e.g., public, non-public).
          Also describe how long you intend to retain your data in these systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          DATA RIGHTS: Describe who will hold the intellectual property rights for your data, and any other legal
          requirements that might need to be addressed.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Awardees must submit an updated DMP within 60 days after effective date of award and receive ITS JPO approval
        for the approach described. The updated DMP must include the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          DATA DESCRIPTION: Address the nature, scope, and scale of the data that will be collected. Define data elements
          within a detailed data dictionary.
        </li>
        <li>
          ACCESS POLICIES: Describe any access restrictions that may apply to your data.
        </li>
        <li>
          DATA STORAGE AND RETENTION: Describe where you intend to store your data and why you have chosen that particular
          option. Different systems may be designated for different types of data (e.g., public, non-public). Also describe
          how long you intend to retain your data in these systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          DATA RIGHTS: Describe who will hold the intellectual property rights for your data, and any other legal
          requirements that might need to be addressed.
        </li>
        <li>
          TIMING: Describe when your data will be shared, and how frequently it will be updated.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Awardees must then maintain the DMP throughout the period of performance with more detailed, updated information
        as it becomes available. At a minimum, the Awardee must update the DMP every six months and any time the Awardee
        shares a new dataset or changes data standards used. By the end of the project, the DMP must be a complete and
        accurate record of all data collected or created through the project.
        <br>
        The DMP must demonstrate the project's full compliance with these requirements and all applicable
        U.S. DOT and federal policies and guidance.

        <h3>Access Requirements</h3>
      </li>
      <p>
        Consistent with federal policy (
        <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174/text#toc-H8E449FBAEFA34E45A6F1F20EFB13ED95" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

        ),awardees must provide public access to data collected or created through the project unless a specific privacy,
        confidentiality, security, or other valid restriction is identified. This presumption in favor of openness must be
        reflected in the research project's DMP. Where valid restrictions to public access exist, awardees must provide
        controlled access to data that is necessary to achieve core research goals. For example, if the purpose of a project
        is to evaluate effectiveness of a new technology, the awardee must provide U.S. DOT evaluators access to enough data
        to support a scientifically-sound evaluation. Furthermore, awardees must make final research results and,
        where possible, sanitized versions of primary data available to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        Final research results must satisfy the reporting and compliance requirements as set forth in the

        , including, but not limited to, the use of Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) numbers, the creation
        and maintenance of a research project record in the Transportation Research Boardâ€™s (TRB) Research in Progress (RiP)
        database, and the timely and complete submission of all required publications and associated digital datasets as such

      <li class="dh-listtype__upperalpha">
        <h3>Data Storage and Retention</h3>
      </li>
      <p>
        Awardees must store their data in systems that provide an appropriate level of user access, functionality and data
        lifecycle management. For more guidelines on acceptable data storage systems for U.S. DOT, see 
        <a href="https://ntl.bts.gov/public-access/guidelines-evaluating-repositories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

        </a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Awardees may use different systems to store different types of data (e.g., public, non-public, primary, derived,
        streaming, static). The ITS JPO has designated several public and controlled access data systems that awardees can use
        to meet their data access and retention requirements, including registering metadata in the
        <a href="https://its.dot.gov/data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          ITS DataHub<img class="in-line-dot-link-new-tab" src="/images/icons/external-tabs.svg" alt="New tab icon." title="Opens in a new tab.">
        </a>.
        Applicants are encouraged to use these shared resources but can propose alternative systems for storing and providing
        access to data via their draft DMP and supplemental information. If ITS JPO determines that a proposed system does not
        provide an appropriate level of user access and functionality and data lifecycle management, the awardee must use the
        systems designated by the ITS JPO. Wherever possible, these determinations will be made prior to award.
      </p>

        Datasets in ITS DataHub are required to be retained for a minimum of five years in accordance
