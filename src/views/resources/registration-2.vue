    <h1>Dataset Registration</h1>
    <p>
      The Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office (JPO) is committed to providing the ITS community access to the most relevant and useful ITS research data and ensuring all datasets associated with ITS JPO funds are cataloged and discoverable through the ITS DataHub and data.gov. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Have a transportation dataset to make accessible on ITS DataHub? Please follow the steps below:
    </p>

                <h2>Step 1: Assess if dataset is ITS research data</h2>
                <p>
                    ITS DataHub is a federated search platform for ITS researchers to find ITS research data. Therefore, we need to make sure all data on this site is ITS research!
                </p>
                <p>
                A data asset is considered ITS research data if it matches all three criteria below:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The project generating the data is related to any system of technologies and operational advancements that, when combined and managed, improve the capabilities of the overall transportation system by integrating advanced information and communications-based technologies (ICT) into transportation infrastructure and vehicles (i.e. involves ITS) [source].
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The project generating the data is comprised of creative work undertaken on a systemic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture, and society (i.e. a research project) [source].
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The data is recorded information, regardless of form or the media on which the data is recorded [source].
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                If your dataset/project matches all criteria above, continue to Step 2. 
            </p>

            <p>
                If your dataset/project matches all criteria above except for number 1, your dataset is considered U.S. DOT-funded research data but is not ITS-related. In this case, your data could be hosted on data.tranportation.gov but is not eligible to be discoverable through ITS DataHub. Please continue by following the Data Inventory Instructions at data.transportation.gov.

            <p>
                Begin the process by downloading and filling out the ITS DataHub Metadata Questionnaire and submitting it via email to data.itsjpo@dot.gov. Please fill out one Metadata Questionnaire for each dataset that will be made available.
            </p>

            <p>
                Upon receipt of the Metadata Questionnaire, the ITS DataHub support team will check to ensure all required information has been provided.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this phase, the ITS DataHub support team will assess the effort required to ingest the dataset. If ITS DataHub requires more details on how to provide access to the data, the ITS DataHub support team may schedule a meeting with the data provider to discuss. An estimated dataset readiness date will be sent to the data provider.

            <p>
                During this phase, the ITS DataHub support team will ingest the metadata and/or data asset into the appropriate U.S. DOT-managed data storage system and set up automatic ingestion processes if needed. The data team will also request a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for the dataset from the National Transportation Library (NTL) if the dataset does not have a pre-assigned DOI.

            <h2>Step 5: Walkthrough and Approval</h2>
            <p>
                Once ingestion is complete, any data assets or promotional materials generated for the dataset will be shared with the data provider and the project’s federal sponsor for review. The ITS DataHub support team will schedule a short, 15-minute walkthrough with the data provider to go over how the dataset’s resources can be discovered through ITS DataHub and answer any questions. After the walkthrough, the data provider will have two to three days to provide additional feedback regarding the dataset. If no additional feedback is received three days after the walkthrough, approval for publication from the data provider will be assumed.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the data provider has previously worked with ITS DataHub, this walkthrough may be waived and a review of materials may be conducted via email.

            <h2>Deprecation</h2>
            <p>
                ITS DataHub follows the data retention schedule of Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and will keep ingested data for up to 5 years or until the data is no longer needed for business purposes, whichever is later. After the initial 5 year retention period, the data asset will be reviewed every 6 months and considered for removal if it has fewer than 5 views and downloads in the last year. Data assets will not be removed without approval from the ITS JPO Data Program’s Product Owner as well as the dataset’s federal sponsor and data owner, as listed in the metadata questionnaire.
