    <h1>Data Management</h1> <!--comment!-->

    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Proper data management is a key component of ITS JPO’s mission to “conduct research, development, and education activities to facilitate the adoption of information and communication technology .” Data management allows ITS JPO to ensure research data is properly cared for and made accessible to the public and third-party researchers to propel ITS research forward and maximize the utility of the data.</p>
    <p>To conduct proper data management, ITS JPO created this page for materials that can help data providers and project managers adhere to U.S. DOT and federal data policies, as well as general data management best practices. Check back regularly for the latest resources.</p>
